# About this code 
The `run_validation_FS_AM_BBN_fmod.m` code is used to verify the implementation of the fluctuation strength model from Osses *et al.* [1] (see `FluctuationStrength_Osses2016` code [here](../../../psychoacoustic_metrics/FluctuationStrength_Osses2016/FluctuationStrength_Osses2016.m)). The verification is performed considering the following test signals:

- Amplitude-modulated (AM) broadband noises with bandwidth $\mathrm{BW}=16~\mathrm{kHz}$, modulation depth $m_{\mathrm{d}}=1$, and sound pressure level $L_{\mathrm{p}}=60~\mathrm{dB}~\mathrm{SPL}$ as a function of the modulation frequency $f_{\mathrm{mod}}$.  

# How to use this code
In order to run this code and reproduce the figures available in the `figs` folder, the user needs to download the dataset of sound files from zenodo <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7933206" target="_blank">here</a>. The obtained folder called `validation_SQAT_v1_0` has to be included in the `sound_files` folder of the toolbox. 

# Results
The figures below compare the results obtained using the `FluctuationStrength_Osses2016` implementation in SQAT with reference data obtained from Fastl & Zwicker [2]. The error bars express the fluctuation strength JND [2]. Results computed using SQAT correspond to time-averaged fluctuation strength values $\mathrm{FS}$.
